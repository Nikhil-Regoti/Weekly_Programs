# Weekly_Programs
In this Repository, I'm going to add programs which I will solve in complete week.
Just open "filename".txt files and in comment you can see the questions, and below there is code. All codes are in Java only.
To run them, just copy the content in the .txt files and paste into any text editor, change class name and save the file as "Classname".java
Now Run the code.
